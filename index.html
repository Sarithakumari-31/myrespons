            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[160]

                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[161]

            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">The calmecac tied together the military, political and sacred hierarchies of the community.[15] Schools that qualified as calmecacs furthered the Aztec religion and forms of government and ensured continued stability by training the society's youth in academic, political, and military skills. In addition to the calmecac in Tenochtitlan, rural villages throughout the Aztec empire would have had calmecacs of their own, 
                ensuring that all civilians had access to comprehensive instruction in religious practice.</p>
